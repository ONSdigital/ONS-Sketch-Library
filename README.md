# ONS-Sketch-Library-v1.0

## Firstly, what is Sketch? 

Sketch is an application used to mock up wireframes and click through prototypes. You can download [Sketch here](https://www.sketchapp.com/get/).

## OK, now what?

Add it to your Libraries in Sketch.

### How do I do that?

You can add this library by going to Sketch > Preferences > Libraries then locating the Sketch file on you local machine.

## How do I use this library?

You can access the symbols by clicking **Insert** and navigating to the ONS-Sketch-Library, under **Symbols**.

## Things to be aware of:

This library has been streamlined as much as possible so that the symbols are responsive and customisable using Overrides.

You'll notice that Radio buttons and checkboxes are the **same** symbol, this is because they are identical (apart from the radio and checkbox elements). You simply change the element to a checkbox or radio.  

You may notice that other symbols like Accordions are in a closed state. You can drag them open and update the icons and buttons using the overrides.
