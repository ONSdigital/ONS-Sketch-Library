# ONS-Sketch-Library

## Firstly, what is Sketch? 

Sketch is an application used to mock up wireframes and click through prototypes. You can download [Sketch here](https://www.sketchapp.com/get/).

## Add the library to Sketch

You can add this library via **Sketch > Preferences > Libraries** by using the **Add Library** button.

## How do I use this library?

You can access the symbols by clicking **Insert** and navigating to the **ONS-Sketch-Library**.

## Things to be aware of:

This library has been streamlined as much as possible so that the symbols are responsive and customisable using Overrides.

You'll notice that Radio buttons and checkboxes are the **same** symbol, this is because they are identical (apart from the radio and checkbox elements). You simply change the element to a checkbox or radio.  

You may notice that other symbols like Accordions are in a closed state. You can drag them open and update the icons and buttons using the overrides.
